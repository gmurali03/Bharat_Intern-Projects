 The objective of the project is to perform Data Visulalization techniques to understand the insight of the data. Machine Learning often required to
 getting the understanding of the data and its insights.This project aims apply various tools to get a visual understanding of the data and clean it
 to make it ready to apply machine learning opertation on it.
